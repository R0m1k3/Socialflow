## Recent Changes

### October 10, 2025
- **Post Type Visual Indicators**: Added visual icons throughout the app to distinguish post types at a glance. Feed posts display Image icon (üñºÔ∏è), Story posts display Smartphone icon (üì±), and posts configured for both show both icons side-by-side. Icons appear consistently across calendar view (desktop grid and mobile list), dashboard "Historique des publications" section, and history page for improved visual clarity.
- **Calendar Auto-Refresh**: Implemented automatic calendar data refresh every 30 seconds using TanStack Query's `refetchInterval` option. Calendar continuously fetches updated scheduled posts without requiring page reload or manual refresh, ensuring users see the latest schedule data in real-time.
- **History Preview Access Control**: Fixed GET /api/posts/:id permissions to use page-based access instead of ownership check. Users can now preview any post from their assigned pages in the history section, not just their own posts. Admin users retain full preview access to all posts.
- **Calendar Permissions System**: Implemented comprehensive page-based permissions for calendar access. Admin users see all scheduled posts with full edit/delete rights. Standard users see only posts from their assigned pages via `user_page_permissions` table, but can only edit/delete their own posts (ownership check via `post.userId`). GET /api/scheduled-posts filters posts by accessible pages (admin bypass). DELETE and PATCH /api/scheduled-posts enforce ownership validation (admin can modify any post, users limited to own posts).
- **Scheduled Posts Data Sync Fix**: Fixed critical bug where editing scheduled post time via PATCH /api/scheduled-posts/:id updated `scheduled_posts.scheduledAt` but not `posts.scheduledFor`, causing calendar/database inconsistency. Now both tables are synchronized: updating scheduledAt automatically updates scheduledFor via `storage.updatePost()`.
- **Scheduled Posts Validation**: Added validation to POST /api/posts requiring `pageIds` when `scheduledFor` is provided. Prevents orphaned scheduled posts that would be invisible in calendar. Returns 400 error: "Les posts programm√©s n√©cessitent au moins une page cible".
- **AI Assistant Admin-Only Access**: Restricted access to AI Assistant to administrators only. Route `/ai` now requires admin role with `adminOnly` prop. Sidebar moved "Assistant IA" link to Administration section (visible only to admins). Backend endpoints (`/api/ai/models`, `/api/ai/generate`, `/api/ai/generations`) protected with `requireAdmin` middleware. Standard users attempting to access AI features see "Acc√®s refus√©" message and receive 403 responses.

### October 9, 2025
- **AI Variants Position**: Repositioned AI-generated text variations to display after "Contenu" card and before "Texte de la publication" card in new-post page for better workflow
- **Calendar Auto-Refresh**: Fixed calendar not updating after creating a new scheduled post. Added `queryClient.invalidateQueries` with `refetchType: 'all'` in `createPostMutation.onSuccess` to force cache invalidation and immediate refetch
- **Dashboard Scheduled Posts Count**: Fixed scheduled posts count showing 0 in dashboard. Problem was that posts with `scheduledFor` were created with status "draft" instead of "scheduled". Solution: POST /api/posts now sets `status = "scheduled"` when `scheduledFor` is provided. Legacy posts updated with SQL: `UPDATE posts SET status = 'scheduled' WHERE scheduled_for IS NOT NULL AND status = 'draft'`
- **Preview in Calendar & History**: Added eye icon (üëÅÔ∏è) buttons to preview posts across calendar (desktop/mobile) and history sections. Clicking the eye icon fetches full post data via GET /api/posts/:id and opens PreviewModal with post text and all associated media. Desktop calendar shows icon on hover; mobile and history show icon always. Preview available in calendar grid, popover ("voir plus"), list view, and recent publications history.
- **Dynamic AI Model Selector**: Replaced hardcoded list of 13 models with dynamic loading from OpenRouter API. Added GET /api/ai/models endpoint that fetches complete catalog (326+ models) from https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models. AI Assistant page now displays all available models with pricing info in scrollable dropdown. Backend accepts optional model parameter to override config model. Loading state shows spinner while fetching models.
- **Read-Only Preview Mode**: Enhanced PreviewModal with optional `readOnly` prop that hides the "Publier" button when viewing posts from calendar or history. Calendar and history now pass `readOnly={true}` to PreviewModal, showing only "Fermer" button. History section updated to display all attempted posts (where `scheduledAt` is in the past) instead of only successfully published posts, and displays `scheduledAt` date instead of `publishedAt`.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with **React** and **TypeScript**, using **Vite** for bundling. **Wouter** handles client-side routing, including protected routes. State management primarily uses **TanStack Query (React Query)** for server state and caching. UI components are built with **Radix UI primitives** and **shadcn/ui** (New York style), styled with **Tailwind CSS**. The design emphasizes a component-based structure, custom path aliases, responsive design with a mobile-first approach, and real-time data synchronization. Dark mode is the default theme.

### Backend Architecture

The backend runs on **Node.js** with **Express.js**, fully implemented in **TypeScript**. It follows a **RESTful API design** with clear endpoints for authentication, user management, AI content generation, media handling, social page management, and post scheduling. **Multer** is used for file uploads, integrating with Cloudinary for cloud storage. **Node-cron** handles background processing for scheduled post publication. Architectural patterns include a service layer (e.g., OpenRouterService, CloudinaryService), storage abstraction, and a middleware-based request processing pipeline. Session management is handled by `express-session`, using `MemoryStore` for development and `connect-pg-simple` with PostgreSQL for production.

### Database Architecture

**PostgreSQL** is the chosen database, utilizing **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe operations and **Neon serverless driver** for WebSocket support. The schema includes core tables for `users`, `cloudinary_config`, `social_pages`, `media`, `posts`, `post_media` (for multi-photo carousels with display order), `scheduled_posts`, and `ai_generations`. Enumerations define `platform`, `post_type`, `post_status`, and `media_type`. Relationships are defined with foreign key cascading deletes for data integrity. **Drizzle Kit** manages schema migrations.

### Media Processing Pipeline

The platform leverages **Cloudinary** for cloud-based image and video storage and transformation. Original files are uploaded to Cloudinary and stored in the database.

**Publishing Strategy**: All publications to Facebook/Instagram use the **original image URL** - the platforms handle cropping and formatting automatically based on the post type (feed/story/carousel).

**Transformations for Preview Only**: Cloudinary generates transformation URLs for UI preview purposes only:
- **Facebook Landscape**: 1200x630px with intelligent center crop (`crop: fill`) - landscape format
- **Facebook Feed / Instagram Feed**: 1080x1080px with intelligent center crop (`crop: fill`) - square format
- **Instagram Story**: 1080x1920px with padding (`crop: pad`) - vertical format

These transformation URLs are stored in the database (`facebookLandscapeUrl`, `facebookFeedUrl`, `instagramFeedUrl`, `instagramStoryUrl`) and displayed in the media library for visual preview, but are NOT used when publishing to social media platforms.

### Authentication & Authorization

Authentication uses **Passport.js** with local strategy and `bcrypt` for password hashing. User roles (`admin`, `user`) control access, with `admin` having full access and `user` limited to publishing features (posts, calendar, media, history). The **AI Assistant** is restricted to administrators only. Session management is via `express-session` with HTTP-only cookies, `sameSite: 'lax'`, and a 7-day duration, secured by a `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable. Routes are protected on both the backend (middleware `requireAuth`, `requireAdmin`) and frontend (`ProtectedRoute` component with optional `adminOnly` prop).

### UI/UX Decisions

The UI is built with **Radix UI** and **shadcn/ui**, leveraging **Tailwind CSS** for styling. The default theme is dark mode. Key design decisions include a component-based architecture for reusability, custom path aliases, and a responsive, mobile-first approach. The platform supports multi-photo carousel posts with drag-and-drop reordering, and a **PreviewModal** offers realistic rendering of posts across Facebook and Instagram formats before publishing. The calendar view is responsive, with a grid layout for desktop and an expandable list view for mobile, allowing editing and deletion of scheduled posts directly from the calendar.

**Infinite Scroll**: Both the media library and new post pages implement infinite scroll using IntersectionObserver for performance optimization:
- **Media Library**: Loads 5 media items initially, then 5 more when scrolling to bottom (max height: 500px)
- **New Post Page**: Loads 12 media items initially in a 3-column grid, then 12 more when scrolling (max height: 500px)
- Visual loading indicator ("Chargement..." with spinner) appears when more content is available
- Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

## External Dependencies

### AI Content Generation

- **OpenRouter API**: Used for AI text generation, specifically with Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet, to create multiple post text variations. Requires `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.

### Cloud Storage

- **Cloudinary**: Provides cloud-based image and video storage, automatic transformations for platform-specific formats, and a global CDN. User-configurable via settings.

### Social Media APIs

- **Facebook Graph API**: Fully implemented for publishing posts to Facebook pages, including multi-photo carousel support (up to 10 photos). Uses a 2-step process: (1) Upload photos as unpublished via POST /{page-id}/photos with published=false to get photo IDs, (2) Create feed post via POST /{page-id}/feed with attached_media parameter containing photo IDs in order.
- **Instagram Graph API**: Partially implemented. Single photo/video posts work. Carousel posts require a 3-step process (not yet implemented): (1) Create individual media containers with is_carousel_item=true, (2) Create carousel container with media_type=CAROUSEL, (3) Publish the carousel container.

### Database Service

- **Neon Serverless PostgreSQL**: The primary database service, utilizing a WebSocket-based connection pooling and the `@neondatabase/serverless` driver. Connection string via `DATABASE_URL`.

### UI Component Libraries

- **Radix UI**: Accessible UI primitives.
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management with validation.
- **Zod**: Schema validation.
- **date-fns**: Date manipulation.
- **react-dropzone**: Drag-and-drop file uploads.
- **Lucide React**: Icon library.
- **@dnd-kit**: Drag and drop functionality for photo carousel reordering.
